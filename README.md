PyBank

For this project, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a sample company. Starting with a set of financial data called budget_data.csv, composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses, I had to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
  - The total number of months included in the dataset
  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

The final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.



PyPoll

Here, I am tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. Starting with a set of poll data called election_data.csv, composed of three columns (Voter ID, County, and Candidate), I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
  - The total number of votes cast
  - A complete list of candidates who received votes
  - The percentage of votes each candidate won
  - The total number of votes each candidate won
  - The winner of the election based on popular vote.

The final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
